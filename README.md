2020 MLB season was hard to predict given it's short nature. This research aims to build a perfect model by deep learning, xgboost, classification tree, etc. I used team batting accumulative stats of the past eight years and then use the model to predict which teams' stats as of 08/13/2020 was worthy of getting into postseason on a traditional 10-team postseason format. The research has lots of limitations like only including the batting stats. Main purpose was to practice with these classification models.
